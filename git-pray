Athena, flint-eyed daughter
   of excellent Zeus,
clear-headed goddess,
   bold-hearted patron of code.
Bright Athena, commits guided
   by forethought,
kind one who draws near us,
   who flees no merge conflict,
your favor sought by many,
   your presence so strong,
so penetrating,
   so unmistakable.
Athena, shining engineer,
   child of wisdom,
I pray to you. Precision
   and unmuddled thought
I ask of you, crisp reason
   and blessed clarity,
surety and conviction,
   quick wit and quick action.
Give me eyes to see far,
   over the architecture;
give me heart to bear legacy code,
   give me strength to hold fast.

Hail, upstream!
Hail, clones of upstream!
And the fork and her clones now!
Look on us here,
with loving patch review,
That waiting we merges win.

Hail to the committers!
Ye contributors, hail,
And all the generous software ecosystem!
Give to us wisdom,
and goodly commits,
And healing rebases, life-long.

Our Father in origin,
   hallowed be your ref.
May your commits come soon,
   and may your pull requests be merged,
   on master as it is in origin/master.
Give us today our daily SHAs,
   and forgive us our push -fs
   as we have forgiven those who push -f against us.
Lead us not into Subversion,
   but deliver us from detached HEAD.
For yours is the source code, and the power, and the glory, forever.
Amen.

Jupiter Committer,
   if on HEAD commits have been lost,
   or if in the nation of versioning
      the owed commit messages have been omitted,
   let it be as if they had been made.

Jupiter Committer,
   if in your pull request there has been any flaw,
      any defect, any contribution guidelines not followed,
   if in your pull request there is a flaw,
      either seen or unseen,
   let it be as if there was not.

I must not fear rebase.
Fear is the history-killer.
Fear is the little-death that births merge conflicts.
I will face my fear.
I will permit rebase to pass over my commits and rewrite my history.
And when it has gone past I will turn the inner log to see its path.
Where the rebase has gone there will be nothing.
Only the tip will remain.
