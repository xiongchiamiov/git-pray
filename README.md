Inspired by a conversation in our development chat:

    James Pearson     The group around your desk has disappeared. Did a solution present itself?
    Scott Vanderlind  @James Not entirely. @Cedric offered "good luck" and @Adam said he'd look into the runtime error the switch script was throwing.
    Cedric Wienold    @Scott when in doubt, use pure git
    Daniel Beardsley  @Scott --weird... is the submodule not added correctly?
                      ya.
    Cedric Wienold    git co branch
                      git pull
                      git sm init
                      git sm update
                      git pray

    [$]> DEITY='Jehovah' git pray
    Our Father in origin,
       hallowed be your ref.
    May your commits come soon,
       and may your pull requests be merged,
       on master as it is in origin/master.
    Give us today our daily SHAs,
       and forgive us our push -fs
       as we have forgiven those who push -f against us.
    Lead us not into Subversion,
       but deliver us from detached HEAD.
    For yours is the source code, and the power, and the glory, forever.
    Amen.
